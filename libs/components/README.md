# components

This library is for all components used throughout the ORCA protocol.

## New components

When introducting new components, make a new folder and export everything using an `index.ts` file, then export the folder from the `src/index.ts`.

## Running unit tests

`TODO: Make unit tests`

Run `nx test components` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
